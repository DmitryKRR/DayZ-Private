DayZ Blizzard Private Server (forked from Bliss Project)
====================================================================
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is a private server project for DayZ. The code is currently compatible with DayZ 1.7.2.5 and ArmA 2 OA beta patch build 95883.

This would not be possible without the work of Rocket and Guru Abdul.

Common Issues
=============

**Problem**: You get errors referring to MSVCR100.dll when the first player connects  
**Solution**: Install MS VC++ 2010 Redist (see Requirements at the Controlcenter repository)

**Problem**: Server not listed on GameSpy in-game server list  
**Solution**: Change reportingIP to **master.gamespy.com** and ensure the game ports (default 2302 - 2305 UDP) are forwarded properly.

**Problem**: "Bad CD Key" messages  
**Solution**: Buy the game.
